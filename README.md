Hello Coding Club(among other readers)! I hate giving descriptions about myself but it is a prerequisite so here we go.
I’m an 18 year old doing engineering (so unique ikr). I function on academic validation and fear of missing out on work.
I love python and know basic web developement and am interested in machine learning .

I would like to contribute to open source projects to enhance my programming skills by working with and learning from experienced developers and work on real world projects , and to add to my programming portfolio
